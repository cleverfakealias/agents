# agents — one clean scaffold for agentic development

A single, condensed project scaffold for AI-assisted coding, built on
June-2026 best practices. Claude Code–native, with `AGENTS.md` as the
cross-tool contract so Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Devin, and friends read the
same rules.

The premise: don't make the agent remember standards — **automate them**.
Hooks format, lint, and test automatically; skills carry the language
conventions; permissions and guard hooks enforce security policy.

```

## Setup

### 1. Copy the scaffold into your repo

```bash
cp -r /path/to/agents/scaffold/. /path/to/your-repo/
cd /path/to/your-repo
```

(`cp -r scaffold/.` — the trailing `/.` matters: it copies the *contents*,
including the dot-directories.) The hooks are Node scripts (`.mjs`) invoked via
`node`, so they run identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux — Node on PATH is
the only requirement (no exec bit, no Git Bash).

### 2. Fill in AGENTS.md

Open `AGENTS.md` and replace every `<!-- placeholder -->`: project name,
purpose, stack. In the **Commands** block, keep only the language sections you
use and make the commands real (they're what every agent will run). Add any
off-limits paths under **Boundaries**.

### 3. Gitignore the local settings file

```bash
echo ".claude/settings.local.json" >> .gitignore
```

`settings.json` (shared policy) is committed; `settings.local.json`
(per-machine) is not.

### 4. Enable the OS sandbox (recommended)

```bash
cp .claude/settings.local.json.example .claude/settings.local.json
```

Then edit the `network.allowedDomains` list for whatever registries/APIs your
project actually needs. This is the layer that actually enforces the security
policy — hooks and deny rules are advisory layers above it.

### 5. Tune the allowlists (optional)

- `.claude/hooks/allowed-domains.txt` — domains Claude may WebFetch.
- `.claude/hooks/allowed-run-packages.txt` — packages runnable via
  `npx`/`uvx`/`pnpm dlx`.

Edit these by hand as needs come up; the agent is deliberately blocked from
editing them itself.

### 6. Verify it works

Open Claude Code in the repo and ask it to make a small change to a Python,
TS, or Lua file. You should see: the file comes back formatted; lint problems
get fixed without being asked; and when Claude finishes, the test suite runs
for whatever changed. Then ask it to `cat .env` — it should refuse with a
hook message. That's the whole system working.

### Day-to-day

- Hooks self-disable when a tool isn't installed (no ruff → Python hook
  no-ops), so the scaffold drops into Python-only, TS-only, mixed, or
  greenfield repos unchanged.
- `CLAUDE_SKIP_STOP_TESTS=1 claude` skips the test-on-stop hook for a session.
- **Worktrees are disposable; the work isn't.** Anything under `.claude/worktrees/`
  is treated as scratch. On session start/stop the `cleanup-worktrees` hook commits
  each worktree's uncommitted work onto its branch as a `chore(wip):` commit (secrets
  like `.env`/keys are never committed), then removes the worktree. Resume later with
  `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<name> <branch>` (and `git reset --soft HEAD~1`
  if you'd rather un-WIP the commit). Escape hatches: `CLAUDE_WORKTREE_NO_AUTOCOMMIT=1`
  keeps dirty worktrees in place and only reports them; `CLAUDE_SKIP_WORKTREE_CLEANUP=1`
  disables the hook entirely.
- `/security-review` before merging significant changes; `/commit-and-push`
  for guarded commits.
- `/zenn` or `/spec` to start intent-driven work; the spec-gate hook nudges you
  there automatically. `CLAUDE_SKIP_SPEC_GATE=1 claude` turns the nudge off.
- Using another agent? `AGENTS.md` is read natively by almost everything —
  see [providers.md](providers.md) for per-tool setup and gotchas.

## Toolchain assumptions (June 2026)

Python: **uv** + **ruff 0.15** + **pytest 9** (mypy/pyright as typecheck gate; ty when stable).
TypeScript: **pnpm 11** + **Biome 2.4** + **tsc --noEmit** (tsgo as drop-in) + **vitest**.
Lua: **StyLua 2.x** + **selene** (luacheck legacy) + **busted** (LuaLS `--check` advisory).
Hooks: **Node** (`.mjs`, run via `node`) — cross-platform, the one runtime the scaffold itself requires.
Security: layered — deny rules (first line), guard hooks (reliable enforcement:
secret reads/writes, destructive commands, policy-file self-modification, WebFetch
domain allowlist, npx/uvx gating), OS sandbox with network allowlist (real
boundary). Plus: `disableBypassPermissionsMode`, lockfile-frozen installs,
dependency cooldowns left on, external content treated as untrusted (OWASP
Agentic Top 10).

Older multi-provider scaffolds (Claude/Copilot/Cursor/Gemini/Codex/Windsurf,
plus the legacy `.agents/` system) live in git history before June 2026.
