# factory

A Claude Code plugin that runs one feature at a time through a small software
factory: you explain what you want, agents write the spec, build it test-first,
review it, and ship it. A person decides at every gate.

```
 you ──► /factory:spec ──► /factory:build ──► /factory:review ──► /factory:ship ──► live
          │ interview        │ test-author       │ 5 lenses          │ PR + CI
          │ spec-critic      │ one task/commit   │ refute each       │ preview + smoke
          ▼                  │ verifier          ▼ finding           ▼ lessons
       GATE: approve      GATE: verifier PASS  GATE: accept     GATE: merge, prod
```

Every stage reads and writes `specs/<slug>/` in the target repo:

| File | Written by | Holds |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `requirements.md` | spec | problem, goals, non-goals, EARS acceptance criteria (AC-n) |
| `plan.md` | spec | design, interfaces, files, AC-to-test table, risks, deploy |
| `tasks.md` | spec, build | ordered tasks, one commit each, `[P]` when parallel-safe |
| `status.md` | every stage | `stage:`, branch, PR, preview, decisions, log, lessons |

`status.md` is the handoff: a fresh session reads it and continues. The
`session-context` mod already shows the newest one at session start.

## What is in the plugin

| Part | Kind | Job |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `factory` | skill | entry point: lists specs and their stage, routes to the next stage |
| `spec` | skill | interview, write the four files, critique, ask for approval |
| `build` | skill | branch, tests first, one task per commit, independent verify |
| `review` | skill | run the review workflow, fix confirmed findings, re-verify |
| `ship` | skill | push, PR, CI, preview and smoke check, hand over merge and prod, lessons |
| `spec-critic` | agent | read-only check of a spec for untestable, vague or missing parts |
| `test-author` | agent | writes the failing acceptance tests from the ACs only |
| `verifier` | agent | read-only: runs the checks, maps each AC to evidence, finds weakened tests |
| `factory-review` | workflow | five read-only review lenses, then one skeptic per finding |
| `test-lock` | hook | asks the user before an edit to a locked acceptance test (`specs/<slug>/tests.lock`) during build, review and ship |
| `evals/` | plugin evals | cases that check the stage skills behave: quick fixes skip the factory, spec stops at the gate |

## Design choices

- **The spec is the contract.** Acceptance criteria in EARS form, each mapped
  to a test before code exists. Code and spec never drift: the spec changes
  first.
- **Makers never grade their own work.** One agent writes the tests, the main
  session writes the code, a third agent verifies, and review findings must
  survive a skeptic. This is the main defense against reward hacking.
- **Small, green steps.** One task per commit, checks after every edit (the
  scaffold's `checks.mjs`), so a bad step is cheap to undo.
- **Files over memory.** All state lives in `specs/<slug>/` and git, so a
  session can end at any point and another can resume.
- **People own the irreversible steps.** Spec approval, merge, and production
  deploy. Push asks once per feature. The plugin's one hook guards the
  acceptance tests; everything else comes from the scaffold's permission
  rules and the user-level mods.
- **Review scales to risk.** Each spec states low, medium or high risk. Low
  gets `/code-review medium`; medium and high get the review workflow; high
  also gets `/security-review` and a list of files for a person to read.

## Requirements in the target repo

1. The scaffold (`../scaffold`) copied in, with AGENTS.md commands filled in
   and `.claude/hooks/checks.json` set up.
2. A **Deploy** line in AGENTS.md (preview, production, smoke check), or the
   ship stage asks for one and adds it.
3. `gh` signed in, for the PR and CI steps.

## Load it

Add the folder to `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_DIRS` in `~/.claude/settings.json`, next
to the mods (see `../mods/README.md`):

```
...;Z:/github_projects/agents/factory
```

Or for one session: `claude --plugin-dir Z:/github_projects/agents/factory`.

## Work on it

```bash
claude plugin validate factory
```

```bash
node --test tests/factory.test.mjs
```

The behavior evals call the model and cost money. Run them before a release
of a changed skill, from the `factory` folder:

```bash
claude plugin eval . --runs 3 --max-cost-usd 5
```

The `scaffold/skills/zenn` skill is the light version of the spec stage, for
repos without this plugin. The research behind the design, and the Claude
Code features still to adopt, are in `docs/research.md`.
