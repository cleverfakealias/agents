# Factory stage 2: build

Goal: a branch where every acceptance criterion has a passing test that an
independent agent has checked.

## Before you start

1. Read `specs/<slug>/status.md`. If `stage` is `spec`, stop and offer
   `/factory:spec`: nothing gets built without approval.
2. Read requirements.md, plan.md and tasks.md. Do not re-plan. If the plan
   cannot work, stop, explain why, and propose a spec change.
3. Make sure the working tree is clean, then create `feat/<slug>` from the
   base branch (or switch to it if it exists). Commit the spec as the first
   commit: `docs(spec): <slug>`.
4. Set `stage: build`, `branch:` in status.md.

## The loop

1. **Tests first (T-1).** Dispatch the `factory:test-author` agent with the spec path.
   Check its table: every automated AC has a test that fails for the right
   reason. List the test files, one repo-relative path per line, in
   `specs/<slug>/tests.lock`. Commit both: `test(<slug>): acceptance tests`.
   From here on the plugin's test-lock hook asks the user before any edit to
   those files. If a test is wrong, fix the spec first, say why, and log it.
2. **One task at a time.** Implement the next unchecked task. Keep the change
   to what the task names. Run the checks from AGENTS.md (the checks hook also
   runs them when your turn ends). Commit with a conventional message, check
   the box in tasks.md, and update "Where to resume".
3. **Parallel tasks.** Tasks marked [P] may run as subagents with
   `isolation: worktree`, one per task, when there are three or more. Merge
   their branches back one at a time and run the checks after each merge.
4. **Stuck.** Two failed attempts at one task: stop, write what you tried
   into status.md, and ask the user.

## Verify

1. When every task is checked, dispatch the `factory:verifier` agent with the spec
   path and the base branch. Do not verify your own work.
2. FAIL: fix each blocking item, commit, and run the verifier again. After
   two FAIL rounds on the same item, stop and ask the user.
3. PASS: paste the verifier report into the status.md Log (checks and AC
   lines only), set `stage: review`, and offer `/factory:review`.

## Rules

- Never weaken, skip or delete an acceptance test to make it pass.
- No new dependencies unless the plan names them; the user still approves
  each install.
- Do not touch `.claude/`, CI workflows, or files the plan does not list
  without asking.
- Do not push in this stage. Pushing belongs to ship.
- Keep commits small and green: each one passes the checks.
